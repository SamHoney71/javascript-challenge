<h1>UFO Search - javascript-challenge</h1>

<h3>Submitted by: Gary Jeter</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This uses HTML, JavaScript, and D3.js to search and display UFO sightings.</p>


<p> UFO Level 1 filters on date only </p>

<p> </p>

<p>  UFO Level 2 filters on date, State, Shape & City</p>

<p> </p>

<p> Note:  Ignore the static folder.  I was unable to delete the static folder at the root folder level.  All code is in the UFO-level-1 and UFO-level-2 folders.  </p>
